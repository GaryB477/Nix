* General Info

This is my rather clumsy attempt at setting up Emacs from scratch. Note that I do not use Emacs other than for personal curiosity; I do most of my programming in Neovim instead.

I let Nix manage my Emacs installation (including downloading, compiling, and pinning packages) using the [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay][emacs-overlay]]. This has 2 important consequences:
- I do not actually need the provided `init.el` file for my installation. It is included so that this config can be used outside of Nix.
- I unfortunately as of now cannot use org-babel for my config. Thus, all configuration currently resides in `config.el`

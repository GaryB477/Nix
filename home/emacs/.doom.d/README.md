# My doom emacs config

This is my clumsy attempt as an emacs noob to create a doom emacs config.

Note: I do not use emacs for anything else than educational purposes. I only have doom emacs for inspiration for my neovim and vscode setups.

TODO: I could move this configuration into a separate repo as a flake.
